/*   mid = (l + r - 1) >> 1 and mid = (l + r - 1) / 2 are the same.
 *  The >> operator in Java is a right shift operator, which divides the operand by 2
   and drops the remainder. So, (l + r - 1) >> 1 is the same as (l + r - 1) / 2
   
   int i=10;  
String s=Integer.toString(i);//Now it will return "10"  

int i=200;  
String s=String.valueOf(i);
